    <string name="contents_gesture_navigation">Android 10 introduces a fully gestural navigation mode that eliminates the navigation bar area and allows apps to use the full screen to deliver richer, more immersive experiences. It retains the familiar Back, Home, and Recents navigation through edge swipes rather than visible buttons. To blend seamlessly with gesture navigation, your should go edge-to-edge, drawing behind the navigation bar to create an immersive experience. To implement this, apps should use the setSystemUiVisibility() API to be laid out fullscreen, and then handle WindowInsets as appropriate to ensure that important pieces of UI are not obscured.
