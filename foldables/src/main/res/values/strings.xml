    <string name="caption_foldables">With Android 10 you can optimize your apps
        for foldables and other large-screen devices.</string>
    <string name="contents_foldables">Building on robust multi-window support,
        Android 10 extends multitasking across app windows and provides screen continuity to maintain your app state as the device folds or unfolds.
        Android 10 adds a number of improvements in <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onResume()">onResume</a> and <a href="https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Activity.html#onPause()">onPause</a> to support multi-resume and notify your app when it has focus.
        It also changes how the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/multi-window#resizeableActivity">resizeableActivity</a> manifest attribute works,
        to help you manage how your app is displayed on foldable and large screens.
        To help you build for foldable devices, you can configure a foldable emulator as a virtual device (AVD) in Android Studio.
        For details on how to optimize your apps for foldables, see the <a href="https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/ui/foldables">developer guide.</a></string>
